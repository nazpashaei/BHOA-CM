# Binary Hiking Optimization Algorithm (BHOA) for Gene Selection
Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Binary Hiking Optimization Algorithm (BHOA) and its enhanced variant BHOA-CM for gene selection from high-dimensional datasets
BHOA is an evolutionary algorithm that mimics hiking behaviors to effectively explore the search space, selecting a subset of significant genes that enhance classification accuracy and reduce computational burden.

Features
BHOA: An optimization algorithm for feature selection.
BHOA-CM: A variant of BHOA that includes genetic operators (crossover, mutation) to handle large datasets more efficiently.
Scalable: Adaptable to different datasets and feature selection tasks.
Gene Selection: Optimized for selecting a subset of genes for downstream analysis or model building.
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed before running the code:

R version 4.0 or higher
Required R packages ("caret","plsgenomics","farff","klaR","e1071","naivebayes", "gamesGA")
